# buddy-reroll

Reroll your [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) `/buddy` companion to any species, rarity, eye, hat, and shiny combination.

## Install

```bash
bun install -g buddy-reroll
```

## Usage

```bash
# Interactive mode (recommended)
buddy-reroll

# Non-interactive
buddy-reroll --species dragon --rarity legendary --eye ✦ --hat propeller --shiny

# Partial spec (unspecified fields are left random)
buddy-reroll --species cat --rarity epic

# Show current companion
buddy-reroll --current

# Restore original binary
buddy-reroll --restore
```

## Options

| Flag | Values |
|---|---|
| `--species` | duck, goose, blob, cat, dragon, octopus, owl, penguin, turtle, snail, ghost, axolotl, capybara, cactus, robot, rabbit, mushroom, chonk |
| `--rarity` | common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary |
| `--eye` | `·` `✦` `×` `◉` `@` `°` |
| `--hat` | none, crown, tophat, propeller, halo, wizard, beanie, tinyduck |
| `--shiny` | `--shiny` / `--no-shiny` |

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (uses `Bun.hash()` to match Claude Code's internal hashing)
- Claude Code

## Runtime Notes

- `buddy-reroll` now resolves Claude installs exposed through small wrapper scripts such as `/usr/bin/claude -> /opt/claude-code/bin/claude`.
- `--current`, `--help`, and `--list` work with read-only/system-managed Claude installs.
- `--restore` and any reroll command require write access to the real Claude binary because the tool creates `<binary>.backup` and patches the executable in place.

## Troubleshooting

If you see a message saying the Claude install is not writable, `buddy-reroll` successfully found Claude Code but cannot patch that installation as the current user. This is common when Claude was installed as a system package and the real binary lives under `/opt` or another root-owned directory.
